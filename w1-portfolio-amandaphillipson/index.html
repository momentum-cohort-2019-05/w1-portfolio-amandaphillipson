                I am super excited to be in the Momentum Learn program!  Before, understanding anything about how computer terminals and webpages worked was an idea that seemed completely out of reach.  I was always afraid I would ruin something or delete the hard drive if I tried anything!  Thankfully, the Momentum staff, and my fellow classmates, foster an environment that has truly made learning computer programing fun.  Not only are we learning to code and setting up our career paths as developers, we are building life-long friendships in the process!
